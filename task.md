Make it so the ‘scratch area’ is a square (ok)

instead of numbers that show up make it fruits ( for now ) that represents a amount of points.

( Apple = 1-100, Orange = 100-200, Watermelon- 200 - 300, Lime = 300 - 400, and strawberry = 400 - 500 ) 

in the back ( in the code ) make a section where you can edit the percentage of each fruit showing up.
